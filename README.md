# Silo MDBList plugin (unofficial Letterboxd build)

This is an unofficial fork of
[Silo-Server/silo-plugin-metadata-mdblist](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-plugin-metadata-mdblist),
based on its 0.5.0
([Silo-Server/silo-plugin-metadata-mdblist#4](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-plugin-metadata-mdblist/pull/4)).
It is not affiliated with Silo, MDBList or any rating service. The plugin
fetches ratings with your own MDBList API key; the rating services' terms
apply to how you use them.

Like the official plugin, it fills in what other metadata providers leave
empty: ratings, the release certification, the Common Sense Media minimum
age, and basic facts such as year, release date, runtime, language, genres,
and show status.

## What this fork changes

- **Stores every rating MDBList has except Trakt's.** Besides IMDb, TMDB,
  Rotten Tomatoes critics and audience and MDBList's own score, which the
  official 0.5.0 keeps, it keeps Letterboxd, Metacritic critics and users,
  Roger Ebert and MyAnimeList, which the official plugin drops. Trakt's rating
  stays out: Trakt has blocked MDBList's API access, so MDBList's figure is
  stale or missing, and Silo keeps at most eight declared rating sources per
  capability, which these fill.
- **Shows Letterboxd on title pages.** With Letterboxd turned on, a title
  page lists IMDb, TMDB and Letterboxd (shown out of 5, like
  `Letterboxd 4.0`), each only when the title has that score. Turn on **only
  Letterboxd**: the other ratings are stored but stay hidden while they are
  off. A title page shows at most three ratings, in the order sources are
  declared. Letterboxd is this plugin's first declaration, but Silo's built-in
  NFO provider declares Rotten Tomatoes ahead of every plugin, so turning on
  Rotten Tomatoes as well gives the third slot to Rotten Tomatoes whenever a
  title has that score.
- **Logos in the web app.** `extras/silo-rating-logos.css` replaces the IMDb
  and Letterboxd text marks with their official logos (see
  [Rating logos](#rating-logos)).
- **Its own version and links.** It keeps the official plugin ID
  (`silo.mdblist`), so it replaces the official plugin when installed; its
  version ends in `-letterboxd`, and its source and support links point to
  this fork. It has no release workflow: you build it and upload it yourself.

## Requirements

Showing Letterboxd needs a Silo server with plugin-declared rating sources,
merged into Silo's `main` on 2026-10-01 (in the `latest` Docker image built
from it):

- [Silo-Server/silo-server#1697](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server/pull/1697)
  gives title pages one list of ratings, IMDb and TMDB plus the sources an
  administrator turns on;
- [Silo-Server/silo-server#1698](https://github.com/Silo-Server/silo-server/pull/1698)
  lets metadata plugins declare their rating sources and adds the switches
  under Settings > Library & Metadata > Ratings.

On a Silo server without them, the plugin installs and fills the same fields,
and Silo stores these per-source ratings from its own fixed list of sources.
Clients show what they show today (IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes from its flat
columns on the web and in poster badges) but none of the other ratings; there
are no Ratings switches, and the logo CSS matches nothing. Nothing breaks, and
the ratings are already stored when the server is updated.

## Why it has to sit below a primary provider

This plugin never identifies an item. It has no search: `Search` returns zero
results by design, even though MDBList has a `/search` endpoint. It only looks
up titles that another provider has already matched, using the IMDb or TMDB ID
that provider resolved.

Silo runs a library's metadata providers as a priority-ordered chain and merges
the results fill-empty, so the first provider to supply a field keeps it. Put a
primary provider — TMDB — above MDBList. The primary resolves identity and
fills the bulk of the record; MDBList then adds the ratings columns the primary
had nothing for.

Given no IMDb or TMDB ID in the request, the plugin returns an empty result. It
does not guess, and it does not fall back to searching.

## What it maps

| MDBList | Silo |
| --- | --- |
| `ratings[source=imdb]` | `rating_imdb` (0-10) |
| `ratings[source=tmdb]` | `rating_tmdb` (0-10) |
| `ratings[source=tomatoes]` | `rating_rt_critic` (0-100) |
| `ratings[source=popcorn\|tomatoesaudience\|audience]` | `rating_rt_audience` (0-100) |
| every source above plus Letterboxd, Metacritic, Roger Ebert and MyAnimeList, and the top-level `score` | `ratings.sources` (0-100 with vote counts; see below) |
| `certification` | content rating |
| `age_rating` + `commonsense` | `advisory_age` / `advisory_source` |
| `year` | year |
| `released` | release date (movies) or first air date (shows) |
| `runtime` | runtime (movies only; a show's figure is not per episode) |
| `language` | original language |
| `genres` | genres |
| `status` | show status (shows only; the host normalises the spelling) |

Silo merges a library's providers fill-empty, so every one of these only lands
where the primary provider left a blank. Genres go to whichever provider
supplies them first.

Keywords and countries are not sent. Silo adds list fields from every provider
together instead of filling a blank, so MDBList's would be added to TMDB's on
every title. Its keywords are slugs (`parent-child-relationship` next to TMDB's
`parent child relationship`) mixed with MDBList's own tags such as
`has-trailer` and `2k-blu-ray`: 0.3.0 appended about 24 of them per title.

Nothing else. The plugin maps no titles, overviews, taglines, artwork, trailers
or external IDs. MDBList's text is English only and would override the
library's language wherever the primary provider left a blank. The host keeps
every provider's trailers, so MDBList's would duplicate TMDB's. And an
enrichment-only provider must not hand the host identity it did not verify, so
MDBList's `ids` object is read only to match batch answers to requests.

MDBList reports each rating twice: `value` on the source's own scale and
`score` normalised to 0-100. The scales are not uniform — IMDb's `value` is out
of 10, TMDB's, Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's are out of 100, Letterboxd's
is doubled to 10 and Roger Ebert's is out of 4 stars — so `score` is the input
wherever it is present, and the per-source conversion is pinned to
`provider/testdata/movie_jaws.json`.

### Per-source ratings

Alongside the four flat keys, the ratings Struct carries a `sources` object:

```json
{
  "imdb": 8.1, "tmdb": 7.6, "rt_critic": 97,
  "sources": {
    "imdb":       {"score": 81, "votes": 673852},
    "tmdb":       {"score": 76, "votes": 10114},
    "rt_critic":  {"score": 97, "votes": 102},
    "letterboxd": {"score": 80, "votes": 876082},
    "metacritic": {"score": 87, "votes": 21},
    "rogerebert": {"score": 100},
    "mdblist":    {"score": 86}
  }
}
```

Keys are `imdb`, `tmdb`, `letterboxd`, `rt_critic`, `rt_audience`,
`metacritic`, `metacritic_user`, `rogerebert`, `myanimelist` and `mdblist`.
Every `score` is 0-100; `votes` is omitted when MDBList has no count. Silo servers
that predate per-source storage read only number-valued keys and skip
`sources`, so the plugin sends it to every server version.

With Silo-Server/silo-server#1698, Silo names IMDb and TMDB itself and keeps
any other key only if the capability declares it, so the manifest lists the
other eight under `capabilities[0].metadata.rating_sources`, Letterboxd first,
each with the short name clients show beside the score, a label, and its scale
(Letterboxd 5, so a stored 80 shows as `4.0`; Roger Ebert 4; Metacritic users
and MyAnimeList 10; the rest 100). Eight is the most Silo keeps per
capability. A server that predates `rating_sources` ignores the declaration
and keeps the keys it knows from its own fixed list, which includes all of
these.

The Common Sense age has no typed field in the plugin API, so it rides in the
free-form metadata map under `advisory_age` and `advisory_source`, which the
host reads.

## Known limitations

**Requires a Silo server that reads `lookup_provider_ids`.** Silo used to call
a metadata provider only when the item carried an ID of the provider's own,
which an enrichment-only provider never has. The manifest now declares
`capabilities[0].metadata.lookup_provider_ids: ["imdb", "tmdb"]`, and servers
that understand the key call this plugin whenever the item carries either ID.
An older server ignores the key; the plugin then installs and configures but
contributes nothing.

**Reports failures as errors, which older servers log as warnings.** The
manifest also declares `bulk_lookup_limit: 100`, which opts the plugin into
Silo's bulk enrichment pass, and the plugin reports a spent quota, an outage or
a missing key as a gRPC error rather than an empty item (see below). Servers
with the pass log those errors at debug level. An older server logs one warning
per item it looks up while no key is saved, the key is rejected, the quota is
spent, or MDBList is down, and otherwise behaves as before.

A genuine 0% Rotten Tomatoes score is reported as "no score". Zero is the
absent sentinel in the host's rating merge and columns, so it cannot currently
be told apart from unrated; fixing it needs nullable rating fields host side.

## Setup

1. Create an API key in your [MDBList](https://mdblist.com) preferences.
2. Build the plugin (`make build-all`) and upload `dist/plugin-linux-amd64`
   (or `-arm64`) under Silo's plugin admin. If the official MDBList plugin or
   another plugin with the ID `silo.mdblist` is installed, this one replaces
   it.
3. Paste the key into the plugin's settings. Without a key the plugin stays
   idle and contributes nothing.
4. Check that **MDBList** sits in each movie and series library's metadata
   provider chain *below* the primary provider. Silo usually adds it there on
   install from the manifest's default priority.
5. Turn on **Letterboxd**, and only Letterboxd, under Settings > Library &
   Metadata > Ratings (needs the Silo changes under
   [Requirements](#requirements)).
6. Run **Bulk Metadata Enrichment** under the admin's scheduled tasks, or wait
   for its hourly run, to look up the titles already in your libraries.

## Rating logos

`extras/silo-rating-logos.css` goes into Admin > Appearance > custom CSS. Silo
stores it in the database, so it survives Silo updates. It replaces the IMDb
and Letterboxd text marks with their official logos, as tall as TMDB's logo,
on title pages, the home hero, the Watch Tonight card and the Watch Together
picker. The logos are embedded in the file, so no request leaves the page;
the source files are in `extras/logos` and are their owners' trademarks.

Silo's markup does not name a rating's source, so the CSS goes by position. It
is right only while Letterboxd is the one rating turned on beyond IMDb and
TMDB: any other source you turn on gets the Letterboxd logo. A lone text mark
that could be either keeps its text, and if Silo changes its markup the rules
stop matching and the text shows again.

## Rate limits, batching and failure behavior

MDBList meters requests per day: 1000 on the free tier, then 10k, 25k, 100k and
250k by paid tier, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Every tier is also capped at 1000
reads per fixed five-minute window.

- **Batching.** Silo asks for one item at a time but runs several match workers
  at once, and its hourly Bulk Metadata Enrichment task keeps 100 lookups in
  flight (the manifest's `bulk_lookup_limit`). Lookups for the same route (IMDb
  or TMDB, movie or show) that arrive within 250 ms of each other go out as one
  request to MDBList's batch endpoint, up to 100 IDs. A lookup with no partner uses the ordinary
  single-title request. If MDBList refuses a batch, the plugin retries it in
  halves; when both halves go through, it remembers the smaller limit for that
  route. TMDB IDs are preferred over IMDb IDs for lookups because the batch
  endpoint's schema types IDs as integers.
- **Quota pause.** When MDBList answers 429, the plugin stops sending requests
  until `Retry-After` (or, for the daily quota, until 00:00 UTC). When a
  successful answer reports `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`, it pauses until
  `X-RateLimit-Reset` without spending another request. Saving a different API
  key lifts the pause.
- **Pacing.** A client-side limiter keeps requests at three a second, under the
  five-minute cap.

A metadata refresh never fails because of MDBList: Silo continues past a
provider's error. A title MDBList does not know is an empty answer. Every other
failure is a gRPC status, so Silo can tell "nothing to find" from "ask again
later" and its bulk pass does not file a paused lookup as a title with no data:

| Failure | Status |
|---|---|
| Quota or burst limit spent, including while paused | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` |
| No API key configured | `FAILED_PRECONDITION` |
| Key rejected (HTTP 401 or 403) | `UNAUTHENTICATED` |
| Outage: unreachable, HTTP 5xx, an error body answering a batch | `UNAVAILABLE` |
| MDBList refused or garbled one title's answer, including an error body | `INTERNAL` |

The plugin logs each failed request, and a quota pause once when it begins. It
does not log a missing key: it simply stays idle until one is saved.

## Building

```sh
make build        # host platform
make build-all    # linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64
```

The build takes its version from `manifest.json` (for example
`0.5.0-letterboxd`), so Silo's plugin admin shows which build is installed.

## Keeping up with the official plugin

This fork is the official plugin plus two commits: the plugin changes and the
logo CSS. With the official repository as the `upstream` remote, move them
onto a new official version with a rebase, run the tests, set the version to
the official one plus `-letterboxd`, and push:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
go test ./...
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
